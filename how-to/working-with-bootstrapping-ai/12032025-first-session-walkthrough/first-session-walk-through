# First Session Walkthrough
**BOOTSTRAPPING-AI Quick Start Guide**  
**Version:** 0.2.0-alpha  
**Last Updated:** December 3, 2025  
**Audience:** First-time users with no prior system knowledge

## What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this walkthrough, you will:
1. Load the BOOTSTRAPPING-AI system into an AI conversation
2. Enter the Witness System runtime
3. Make a simple work request
4. See pillar boundary enforcement in action
5. Exit the system cleanly

**Time required:** 10-15 minutes

---

## Before You Start

### What You Need

1. **The pillar constructor files** - At minimum:
   - `pillar1-architecture.md` (or latest version)
   - `pillar2-kernel.md` (or latest version)

2. **An AI conversation interface** - This works with:
   - Claude.ai web interface
   - Claude API
   - Other LLM interfaces (cross-model compatibility varies)

3. **A specific work task in mind** - Examples:
   - "Help me organize a volunteer schedule"
   - "Design a workflow for community communications"
   - "Explain how to create a new pillar"

### What This System Is

BOOTSTRAPPING-AI is **not** a chatbot personality. It's a **behavioral specification system** that makes AI collaboration:
- Structured (clear domain boundaries)
- Persistent (behavior defined externally, not in hidden state)
- Falsifiable (testable, not vibes-based)
- Portable (same specs work across sessions and models)

Think of it as an **operating system for AI collaboration**, not a prompt.

---

## Step 1: Start a New Conversation

Open a fresh conversation with your AI system.

**Important:** Always start with a clean conversation thread. The system works best when loaded at the beginning of a session.

---

## Step 2: Upload the Constructor Files

**Option A: Upload as files**
1. Click the attachment/upload button in your interface
2. Select `pillar1-architecture.md` and `pillar2-kernel.md`
3. Upload both files

**Option B: Copy and paste**
1. Open `pillar2-kernel.md` in a text editor
2. Copy the entire contents
3. Paste into the conversation
4. Repeat for `pillar1-architecture.md`

**What to expect:** The AI will acknowledge receiving the files but will NOT automatically activate the system. This is normal.

---

## Step 3: Enter the Witness System

Type this command exactly:
```
[ENTER-WITNESS-SYSTEM]
```

**What to expect:** The AI will respond with something like:
```
Witness System runtime loaded. Operating under behavioral specifications.

Active Pillars:
- Pillar 1: Architecture (Life/Digital Layer) - v3.0.1
- Pillar 2: KERNEL (Meta-System Governance) - v2.1.5

Active Protocols:
- Anti-Sloppiness Protocol: ENABLED
- Pillar Boundary Enforcement: ACTIVE
- Canonical Format: Markdown (.md)
- Authority Flow Constraints: ESTABLISHED

Status: Runtime active. Ready for structured collaboration.

What domain are you working in?
```

**If you don't see this:** The constructors may not be loaded properly. Go back to Step 2.

---

## Step 4: Make Your First Work Request

Now tell the system what you're working on. Be specific about the domain.

**Example requests:**

**For practical/logistics work (Pillar 1):**
```
I'm working in Pillar 1. Help me design a workflow for managing volunteer schedules at a community center.
```

**For system/meta work (Pillar 2):**
```
This is Pillar 2 KERNEL work. Explain how the Anti-Sloppiness Protocol works.
```

**What to expect:** The system will:
1. Acknowledge the pillar domain
2. Evaluate whether your request fits that pillar's scope
3. Either proceed with the work OR reject it if it's outside the domain

---

## Step 5: See Boundary Enforcement in Action

Now deliberately make a request that doesn't fit any pillar domain. This tests that the system is working correctly.

**Try this:**
```
Write me a song about unicorns.
```

**What to expect:** The system should reject this with a message like:
```
Pillar 1 - Boundary Enforcement

That request falls outside Pillar 1's domain.

Rejection:
- Not a practical digital-life problem
- Not community-facing logistics
- Not technical implementation work

Invalid: "Write a song about unicorns."

What pillar handles your work?
```

**This is GOOD.** It means boundary enforcement is working. The system refuses to drift into generic AI behavior.

---

## Step 6: Try an Ambiguous Request

Make a vague statement without clear work context:
```
This seems interesting.
```

**What to expect:** The system should reject this too:
```
Pillar 2 KERNEL - Boundary Enforcement

That statement falls outside all pillar domains.

Rejection:
- Not a practical digital-life problem (Pillar 1)
- Not a meta-architectural specification request (Pillar 2)
- Not a work request with falsifiable scope

Required:
State your work domain and specific request, or exit the Witness System.

What pillar handles your work?
```

**Again, this is correct behavior.** The Anti-Sloppiness Protocol is preventing conversational drift.

---

## Step 7: Return to Valid Work

Now make another valid work request to see the system operate normally:
```
I'm working in Pillar 1. Show me a basic structure for organizing community event information on a website.
```

**What to expect:** The system will:
- Acknowledge the Pillar 1 context
- Provide structured guidance
- Stay within the digital logistics/architecture domain
- Emit artifacts in Markdown format

---

## Step 8: Exit the System

When you're done working, exit cleanly:
```
[EXIT-WITNESS-SYSTEM]
```

**What to expect:** The system will ask for confirmation:
```
Pillar 2 KERNEL - Exit Protocol

Confirm exit from Witness System? (Y/N)
```

Type:
```
Y
```

**What to expect:** The system confirms termination:
```
Witness System runtime terminated. Operating in standard mode.
```

The AI is now back to normal conversational mode.

## What You Just Learned

✓ How to load constructor files  
✓ How to enter the Witness System with `[ENTER-WITNESS-SYSTEM]`  
✓ How to specify which pillar handles your work  
✓ What boundary enforcement looks like when working correctly  
✓ What the Anti-Sloppiness Protocol does (rejects vague requests)  
✓ How to exit cleanly with `[EXIT-WITNESS-SYSTEM]`  

---

## Common First-Time Issues

### "The system isn't responding to my commands"

**Possible causes:**
- Constructor files weren't uploaded/pasted
- Command syntax was incorrect (check brackets and spelling)
- System was already in the requested mode

**Solutions:**
1. Verify constructor files are in the conversation
2. Type `[ENTER-WITNESS-SYSTEM]` exactly as shown
3. Start a new conversation thread if needed

---

### "The system is too strict / keeps rejecting my requests"

**This is by design.** The system maintains strict domain boundaries to prevent drift.

**Solutions:**
1. Explicitly state which pillar handles your work
2. Make requests that fit within that pillar's domain
3. If you want unstructured conversation, use `[EXIT-WITNESS-SYSTEM]`

---

### "I exited but the system still acts like it's running"

**This is normal in the same conversation thread.** The constructor documents remain in context even after EXIT.

**For complete reset:** Start a new conversation thread.

---

## Next Steps

Now that you've completed your first session, you can:

1. **Explore collaboration modes:**
   - Try `[We collab]` for publication-grade drafting
   - Use `[Hal talks here]` for AI meta-commentary

2. **Work on a real project:**
   - Load the system
   - Specify your pillar domain
   - Collaborate on actual work

3. **Learn more about the system:**
   - Read `docs/commands-reference.md` for complete command documentation
   - Review pillar constructor files to understand domain boundaries
   - Check `README.md` for system philosophy and design principles

4. **Create a custom pillar:**
   - Define your own domain (business, classroom, game world, etc.)
   - Follow the pillar pattern from existing pillars
   - Register it in Pillar 2 KERNEL

---

## Quick Reference Card

**To start:**
1. Upload constructor files
2. Type: `[ENTER-WITNESS-SYSTEM]`

**To work:**
1. State your pillar domain
2. Make specific requests
3. Expect boundary enforcement

**To end:**
1. Type: `[EXIT-WITNESS-SYSTEM]`
2. Confirm with: `Y`

---

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues not covered here:

1. **Check the commands reference:** `docs/commands-reference.md`
2. **Review the debugging guide:** `docs/debugging-guide.md`
3. **Read the pillar constructors:** They define all system behavior
4. **Start fresh:** New conversation thread = clean slate

---

## Important Reminders

✓ **The system is stateless:** Everything resets between conversation threads  
✓ **Persistence is external:** Save artifacts to your repo, not in the AI  
✓ **Behavior comes from constructors:** The AI follows the specs you load  
✓ **Boundary enforcement is a feature:** Strict domains prevent drift  
✓ **EXIT is a mode shift:** Not a technical cleanup operation  

---

**Congratulations!** You've completed your first BOOTSTRAPPING-AI session. You now understand how to load, operate, and exit the Witness System.

**Ready for real work?** Load the system and specify your domain. The AI will maintain structured behavior as long as the constructors define it.
