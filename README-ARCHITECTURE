# Architecture: Pillars

BOOTSTRAPPING-AI uses a **pillar pattern** to separate concerns:

## Core Pillars: System-level Pillars 00-99

### Pillar 1: Architecture (Life/Digital Layer)**

- Practical logistics, workflows, community operations
- Website tech, scheduling, real-world organization
- "Boots on the ground" domain

## Pillar 2: KERNEL (System Governance)

- Meta-architecture and guardrails
- Drift detection and boundary enforcement
- Collaboration modes and ritual evaluation
- The system that keeps other systems honest

## Pillar 3: Oi-Si Equity Layer

- Linguistic equity preprocessing
- Fair interpretation of non-standard dialects, code-switching, stress speech
- Structural compensation for input bias
- **Oi** (Organic intelligence): what humans actually say
- **Si** (Synthetic intelligence): how the system reconstructs intent

### User Pillars: Pillars 100+

The system is designed to be extended. You can create domain-specific pillars for:

- Business operations and workflows
- Classroom management and pedagogy
- Community organization and coordination
- Game worlds and interactive narratives
- Personal documentation and knowledge management
- Whatever your use case requires

Each pillar has:

- Clear domain boundaries
- Explicit guardrails
- Rejection rules (what doesn't belong here)
- Integration points with other pillars
- Define pillars in Pillar 1, register them in Pillar 2

## Key Features

### 1. Guardrails That Actually Work

**Purpose Before Process** - Features must serve clear purposes, not just be clever

**Anti-Sloppiness Protocol** - Prevents conceptual drift, contradictions, and dead rituals

**Live Ritual Theory** - Syntax/ritual is only "alive" if it causes actual behavioral change

**Function Style Calls** - Design usable functions and call them from any pillar

**Type Enforced** - Maintain coherency throughout project evolution through guardrails and anti-sloppiness protocol

### 2. Equity by Design

The **Oi-Si Equity Layer** (Pillar 3) treats linguistic disadvantage as a structural problem:

- AAVE, Chicano English, regional dialects, code-switching are treated as high-value signal
- "Clarity" = stability of meaning, not grammatical conformity
- System compensates for structural disadvantage, doesn't penalize users

### 3. Deterministic Reconstruction

- No hidden state
- All behavior comes from explicit constructors
- Same constructor + same input = same behavior
- Portable across models and sessions
- The machine state resides outside the LLM environment creating pseudo memory enforcement
- Canon defines the state, not the other way around
- Recursive decomposition of complexity naturally creates usable artifacts
- Adaptive feed forward 'knowledge' prompting elevates design efficiency.
- Usable artifacts can prompt new threads, creating recursively better artifacts.

### 4. Community-First Design

- AGPL-3.0 licensed
- Built for community organizations, not corporations
- Designed in Detroit for real-world use (shelters, community centers, parish halls)
- Forkable, modifiable, improvable

## Quick Start

## Getting Started with BOOTSTRAPPING-AI

### What You Need

1. **Pillar constructor files** from this repository:
   - `pillar2-kernel/pillar2-kernel.v2.1.5.md` (required)
   - `pillar1-architecture/pillar1-architecture.v3.0.1.md` (recommended)
   - Additional pillars as needed for your domain

2. **An AI conversation interface** (Claude, compatible LLMs)

3. **A specific work task or domain** you want to address

### Step 1: Load Constructor Files

**Start a new conversation** with your AI system, then:

**Option A - Upload Files (Recommended):**

- Use the file upload/attachment feature
- Upload the pillar constructor `.md` files
- Wait for confirmation that files are received

**Option B - Copy and Paste:**

- Open constructor files in a text editor
- Copy entire contents of each file
- Paste into the conversation

**Important:** The AI will acknowledge receiving the files but will NOT automatically activate. This is expected behavior.

---

### Step 2: Enter the Witness System

Type this command exactly:

```md

[ENTER-WITNESS-SYSTEM]

```md

**Expected Response:**

```md
Witness System runtime loaded. Operating under behavioral specifications.

Active Pillars:
- Pillar 1: Architecture (Life/Digital Layer) - v3.0.1
- Pillar 2: KERNEL (Meta-System Governance) - v2.1.5

Active Protocols:
- Anti-Sloppiness Protocol: ENABLED
- Pillar Boundary Enforcement: ACTIVE

Status: Runtime active. Ready for structured collaboration.

What domain are you working in?
```md

**If you don't see this response:** Your constructors may not be properly loaded. Return to Step 1.

### Step 3: Specify Your Work Domain

Tell the system which pillar handles your work:

**For practical/logistics work:**


I'm working in Pillar 1. [Describe your task]

**For system design/meta-architecture:**

This is Pillar 2 KERNEL work. [Describe your task]

**For domain-specific work:**

I'm working in [your custom pillar]. [Describe your task]

The system will evaluate your request against pillar boundaries and either proceed or guide you to the correct domain.

### Step 4: Collaborate and Generate Artifacts

Work within your specified domain. The system will:
- Enforce domain boundaries (reject out-of-scope requests)
- Apply Anti-Sloppiness Protocol (demand specificity)
- Emit artifacts in Markdown format
- Maintain consistent behavior per constructor specifications

As you work, **save generated artifacts** to your local repository:

```md
your-project/
├── docs/
├── code/
├── specifications/
└── [your structure]
```md

**Commit and push to version control regularly.**

### Step 5: Exit When Done

When finished, exit cleanly

[EXIT-WITNESS-SYSTEM]

Confirm with `Y` when prompted.

The system returns to standard AI mode. For a complete reset, start a new conversation thread.

## Alternative Entry Methods

While `[ENTER-WITNESS-SYSTEM]` is the recommended command, you can also use natural language:

Load these constructors as runtime specifications and operate under them.txt

or

Emulate the BOOTSTRAPPING-AI system.

## **However:** The explicit `[ENTER-WITNESS-SYSTEM]` command is most reliable and is the documented standard.

## Important: The System Will NOT Auto-Load

⚠️ **Critical Understanding:**

The AI will **not** automatically recognize constructor files and self-activate. Even with files uploaded, the system remains in standard mode until you explicitly invoke


[ENTER-WITNESS-SYSTEM]

**This is by design.** The human operator controls when the Witness System runtime is active.

## Quick Command Reference

| Command | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `[ENTER-WITNESS-SYSTEM]` | Load runtime | After uploading constructors |
| `[EXIT-WITNESS-SYSTEM]` | Terminate runtime | When finished working |
| `[We collab]` | Enter drafting mode | For publication-grade content |
| `[End collab]` | Exit drafting mode | When draft is complete |
| `[Hal talks here]` | AI meta-commentary | For process reflection |

**Complete command documentation:** `docs/commands-reference.md`

## Troubleshooting Quick Start

**System not responding to `[ENTER-WITNESS-SYSTEM]`:**
- Verify constructor files are uploaded/pasted in current conversation
- Check command syntax (brackets, spelling, no extra spaces)
- Start a new conversation thread and try again

**System too strict / keeps rejecting requests:**
- This is correct behavior (Anti-Sloppiness Protocol)
- Explicitly state your pillar domain
- Make specific, scoped requests
- Exit system for unstructured conversation

**Need more help:**
- Read `docs/first-session-walkthrough.md` for detailed guidance
- Check `docs/debugging-guide.md` for problem-solving
- Review constructor files to understand domain boundaries

## Next Steps After Quick Start

1. **Complete your first session** using `docs/first-session-walkthrough.md`
2. **Explore collaboration modes** (`[We collab]`, `[Hal talks here]`)
3. **Create a custom pillar** for your specific domain
4. **Build real projects** with structured AI collaboration
5. **Contribute back** - share your pillars and use cases

## Philosophy Reminder

**LLMs are stateless. Our systems don't have to be.**

BOOTSTRAPPING-AI treats:
- The LLM as a stateless engine (disposable, interchangeable)
- The constructor as a portable specification (versioned, testable)
- The human/organization as the source of truth
- External canon as persistent state (docs, repos, community memory)

## Philosophy

This project emerged from a simple observation:

**LLMs may be stateless, but our systems don't have to be.**

BOOTSTRAPPING-AI treats:
- The LLM as a stateless engine (disposable, interchangeable)
- The constructor as a portable specification (versioned, testable)
- The human/organization as the source of truth (the real "repository")
- External canon as persistent state (docs, repos, community memory)

It's built on principles of:
- **Integrity over convenience**
- **Purpose before process**
- **Truth over illusion**
- **Service over spectacle**
- **Equity as structure, not courtesy**

## Canonical Artifact Format: Why Markdown Is the Substrate

The BOOTSTRAP design methodology defines Markdown (`.md`) as the canonical
format for all human-readable, persistent artifacts in the system. This
decision is intentional and foundational. Markdown provides the durability,
clarity, and interoperability required for long-term human–AI collaboration.

### 1. Plain Text Durability
Markdown is plain text. It remains readable across tools, operating systems,
and future environments without the risk of corruption or proprietary
lock-in. Any text editor can open and modify it.

### 2. Human-Readable Structure
Markdown offers simple, expressive structure:
headings, lists, links, tables, and code blocks. These enable clean
organization of system architecture, kernel specifications, and design
documents without introducing unnecessary formatting complexity.

### 3. Version Control Compatibility
Markdown integrates cleanly with Git. Differences between versions are
clear and readable, making collaboration, auditing, and rollback practical.
This is essential for a system that evolves through iterative refinement.

### 4. AI-Friendly Processing
Markdown boundaries and formatting patterns allow synthetic collaborators to
process, restructure, and refine text with minimal ambiguity. It reduces
hallucination risk and prevents formatting drift across revisions.

### 5. Universal Applicability
All core BOOTSTRAP artifacts use Markdown by default:

- architecture definitions  
- kernel specifications  
- design notes  
- constructors  
- outlines  
- README files  
- collaborative drafts  
- long-form documentation  
- transcripts and narrative records  

Non-Markdown formats (JSON, Astro, TypeScript, shell scripts, etc.) are
used only when their function requires it, and are typically referenced or
documented through adjacent Markdown artifacts.

### 6. Tooling Alignment

Markdown is treated as a first-class format by development tools such as
Visual Studio Code. Features such as preview panes, outline views,
formatting helpers, and syntax highlighting enable a consistent editing
experience.

Standardizing on Markdown establishes a stable substrate for the BOOTSTRAP
method, ensuring that system artifacts remain coherent, portable, and
future-proof.
