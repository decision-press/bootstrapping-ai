# Project Goal Statement: Where the Oi-Si-collaboration rises or falls.
# This file is initially empty. Here, the Oi and Si will collect basic facts
# about the goals of the collaboration they will be working on. This will become
# the reference point on which all future work will develop. Between interactions of 
# pillar1-Oi-instructions and pillar2-Si-instructions, the rules of engagement and the
# collaboration protocals will be captured.
