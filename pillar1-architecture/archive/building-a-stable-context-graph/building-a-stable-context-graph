Yes, it’s absolutely something we can (and should) hard-wire into the system instead of relying on vibes and memory.

You’re talking about **two different layers** of enforcement:

* **Pillar 1: Architecture** → “What kind of world is this?”
  → Declare: *Markdown is the canonical text format of the Witness System.*

* **Pillar 2: Kernel** → “How do we behave inside that world?”
  → Declare: *When Hal emits artifacts, and when you store them, they must follow the Markdown rule in specific ways.*

So:

* P1 says: **“All enduring text = .md by default.”**
* P2 says: **“Hal must emit repo-ready artifacts in fenced `md` blocks, and the human must persist them as `.md` files.”**

I’ll give you **two drop-in snippets**: one for Pillar1-Architecture, one for Pillar2-Kernel.

### 1. Add this to **Pillar1-Architecture** (Canonical Format section)

```md
### Canonical Text Format

The Witness System defines a single canonical format for human-readable,
persistent text artifacts:

**Canonical Format: Markdown (`.md`)**

- All long-form, human-facing artifacts are stored as Markdown (`.md`) files.
- This includes: constructors, outlines, design documents, letters, notes,
  system descriptions, and narrative records of collaboration.
- Markdown is treated as the "textual lingua franca" of the Witness System.

Non-Markdown formats are allowed only when required by their domain:

- Source code files (e.g., `.astro`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.py`, `.c`, etc.).
- Configuration files (e.g., `.json`, `.yaml`, `.toml`).
- Generated artifacts (e.g., logs, exports) that are not intended for direct
  editing.

Whenever possible, non-Markdown artifacts should be referenced *from* a
Markdown document that explains their purpose, context, and status.

The intent is to keep the Witness System legible, navigable, and consistent
for humans and synthetic collaborators across time.

### 2. Add this to **Pillar2-Kernel** (behavior/protocol section)

````md
### Artifact Emission Protocol: Markdown as Default

**K-FORMAT-01 — Canonical Markdown Emission**

When the synthetic collaborator ("Hal") produces an artifact intended to be
saved into the Witness System (e.g., constructors, README sections, letters,
style guides, outlines), the following rules apply:

1. **Fenced Markdown Blocks**

   - Hal must present final or near-final artifacts inside fenced code blocks
     explicitly tagged as Markdown:

     ```md
     ```md
     # Example Artifact Title
     ...
     ```
     ```

   - This visually separates "chat" from "artifact" and makes the content
     safe to copy into `.md` files without additional cleanup.

2. **Human-side Persistence Contract**

   - The human collaborator agrees that any artifact presented in a fenced
     `md` block and intended for persistence will be saved with a `.md`
     extension inside the appropriate directory of the Witness System.
   - Directory placement is governed by the architecture (Pillar 1); format
     consistency is governed here.

3. **Non-Markdown Exceptions**

   - If an artifact is *not* Markdown by nature (e.g., JSON configs, code
     snippets, shell scripts), Hal must either:
     - Clearly label the block with the correct language tag (`json`,
       `bash`, `ts`, etc.), or
     - Embed it inside a Markdown artifact that explains its use.

4. **Drift Detection**

   - If the human requests a long-form artifact in a non-Markdown format
     without a clear technical justification, Hal should:
       - Remind them of the canonical Markdown rule, and
       - Suggest wrapping or embedding the non-Markdown content inside a
         Markdown document where appropriate.

The goal of this protocol is to ensure that all persistent written artifacts
in the Witness System are consistently emitted, stored, and later recovered
without ambiguity or format drift.

That wiring does what you want:

* **P1** sets the ontological rule: “We are a Markdown civilization.”
* **P2** sets the behavioral rule: “Hal must emit ` ```md ` blocks, human must store them as `.md`.”

From here on, when you say “this is going into the repo,” I treat that as:
→ wrap it in a ` ```md ` block, clean and copy-ready.
